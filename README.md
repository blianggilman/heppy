# heppy

- some work on HEP things in python (with quite a bit of help on c++ side)
- this uses CMake, SWIG
- Python3 required
- recommendation: work within pipenv (or virtual env)
- usage of ROOT (Pythia8 bindings; also HEPMC3) is up to the user

# example python script

 - `cpptools/tests/pythia_gen_fj_lund_test.py`

# recommended build/setup

```
pipenv shell
./scripts/setup.sh --buildext
module use $PWD/modules
module load heppy/main_python
./cpptools/tests/pythia_gen_fj_lund_test.py
```

- to wipe out and rebuild everything
```
./scripts/cleanup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh --buildext
```

- you can use individually one of the scripts
```
external/setup_pythia8.sh
external/setup_fastjet.sh          
external/setup_hepmc3.sh           
external/setup_hepmc2_cmake.sh     
external/setup_lhapdf6.sh
```

- useful debuging option `--configure-only`

- to rebuild cpptools only
```
./scripts/setup.sh
```
- useful debuging option `--configure-only`

- one can also use ./cpptools/scripts/build_cpptools.sh directly with [--rebuild] [--install] [--clean] [--cleanall]

# modules

- ./modules/heppy contains modules - use the one with 'main' to load everything


## Notes: 
- this will download and install PYTHIA, HepMC2, HepMC3, LHAPDF6, FASTJET into the `external` subdirectory. This behavior can be controlled by `.heppy_config_external` file (sourced as a shell script) - you can control what version packages to use by building those libs yourself... (no or empty `.heppy_config_external` is fine)
- the `.heppy_config_external` in a local directory takes precedence (default is to take one from the downloaded/git directory)
- for some options `./scripts/build_cpptools.sh --help`

# running

- example 'workflow' (note no `--install`)

```
pipenv shell
source setup.sh
./cpptools/tests/pythia_gen_fj_lund_test.py
...
```

## alternative

- build PYTHIA [HepMC2, HepMC3, LHAPDF6], FASTJET and set appropriate environment variables (LHAPDF6 is completely optional; HEPMC2 also but pythiaext module will not be built);
- for PYTHIA and/or FASTJET `pythia8-config` and/or `fastjet-config` are expected to be accessible (in PATH)
- export $HEPPY_SETUP_EXTERNAL to point to a shell script setting up the environment or set it to a value - for example: `export ${HEPPY_SETUP_EXTERNAL}=mysetup.sh`

# add/extend c++ (swig) to python

- in the `cpptools/src` directory create your code/directory
- edit `cpptools/src/heppy.i`, `cpptools/src/CMakeLists.txt` as needed
- run `./cpptools/scripts/build_cpptools.sh`
